- 👋 Hi, I’m Zac!  Thank you so much for checking out my little plot on GitHub!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything to do with graphics/engine programming and game development more generally.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything to do with computer graphics programming fundamentals and the OpenGL spec (via GLFW & SDL).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything that is a cool or interesting solution to a gnarly problem domain.
- 📫 How to reach me on twitter @theLogicistZac or shoot me a DM on here.  I hope you have a great day!
