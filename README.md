- 👋 Hi, I’m Zac!  Thank you so much for checking out my little plot on GitHub!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the full spectrum of web3 development as well as 2D game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development via Ruby/Sinatra and the MERN stack. iOS/Droid are on the list as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything that is a cool or interesting solution to a gnarly problem domain.
- 📫 How to reach me on twitter @theLogicistZac or shoot me a DM on here.
